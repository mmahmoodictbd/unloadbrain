Imagine, you hired a new engineer to help with your software products, or you are an engineer who just got hired. What would be your expectation? Being
 productive, as soon as possible, right?
 
I am an engineer, worked in different software company for last 10 years, conducted tons of interviews, helped company hire and onboard new-hires. Here are
 some notes on good and bad onboarding ideas.

### Good Ideas:
  - Business Analyst / Product Owner talk about the products.
  - Architect / Developer talks about architecture, explain how different parts of the product are connected.
  - Set a 'buddy' for the new-hire.
    - A dedicated person to help the new-hire.
    - This will prevent bouncing from person-to-person to get simple things done.
    - A 'buddy' is not a mentor.
  - Duties of a 'buddy':
    - Answer/help with anything new-hire might need.
    - Help with getting access to Code Repository / Artifact Repository / Build System / AWS etc.
    - Setup meetings with different people who can explain things to new-hire.
    - Show the codebase.
    - Explain how CI/CD process works in the company.
    - Help to run project on the local machine.
    - Help to pick up small ticket, help the new-hire as much possible. Merge the code and test! This might seems hand holding, but trust me it works.
  - Tips for the person who play to the 'buddy' role:
    - Try to write down the overview of different talks. Send the overview as a chat message after the talk.
    - List all links, e.g. codebase, Sonar, Jenkins, Artifactory.
    
### Bad Ideas:
  - Week long boring training session.
  - "Just read the code, you’ll figure it out. It’s just code."
  - Ask to Read the Fu**ing Manual (RTFM), aka Confluence / Wiki / readme pages.
