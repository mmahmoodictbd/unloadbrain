Recently I started working on application security. Worked as a backend software engineer for my years, had some
 basics, but now I get to learn how to hack a system.

These are the vulnerable apps that helped me a lot to learn new concepts:
- [citizenstig-nowasp](https://github.com/mmahmoodictbd/dev-setup/blob/master/security/vulnerable-apps/docker-compose-citizenstig-nowasp.yml)
- [juiceshop](https://github.com/mmahmoodictbd/dev-setup/blob/master/security/vulnerable-apps/docker-compose-juiceshop.yml)
- [web-dvwa](https://github.com/mmahmoodictbd/dev-setup/blob/master/security/vulnerable-apps/docker-compose-web-dvwa.yml)
- [webgoat](https://github.com/mmahmoodictbd/dev-setup/blob/master/security/vulnerable-apps/docker-compose-webgoat.yml)

Checkout the docker-compose files: [dev-setup-security](https://github.com/mmahmoodictbd/dev-setup/tree/master/security)

To get my basics right, I used [Security Knowledge Framework](https://github.com/mmahmoodictbd/dev-setup/blob/master/security/docker-compose-security-knowledge-framework.yml).
