Recently I moved from my old place in Amsterdam to Almere. I listed down all the tasks I needed to finish.

Here is my two cents:

- Notify the current owner (2 months ahead of the moving date)
  - Ask when we can cancel rent.
  - Cancel house rent.
  - Ask when we can get our deposit back.
  
- Repair the old place (a month ahead of the moving date)
  - Fill nail holes with wood filler and drywall filler.
  - If there is something you cannot fix, find a handyman with a friend's recommendation.
  - My experience with handyman are not good. I picked MrFix from online, both handyman did terrible jobs.

- Find moving company (a month ahead of the moving date)
  - They charge hourly. I used [BearStorm Moving Service](https://www.facebook.com/bearstormmovingservice), quite happy with the service.
  - I did the packing myself.

- Packing (a month ahead of the moving date)
  - Shrink wrap (Krimpfolie in Dutch, can be found in Gamma or Karwei)
  - Buy boxes and tapes from Action.

- Cancel electricity, gas and water (a month ahead of the moving date)
  - Take pictures of the meter reading before leaving the place.
  
- Cancel internet (1 or 2 months ahead of the moving date)
  - If you are gonna use the same vendor, make all appointments to install new router/modem in your new place.
  - Otherwise, choose a new vendor as soon as possible as make installation appointment.
    - Appointment date can be the same date as moving date, maybe in the afternoon.
    - Ask the previous tenant to keep the router/modem for you.

- Leave new house address or phone number in old house so that new tenant can forward mails.

- When you move in to a new place
  - Take pictures of the meter reading for electricity, gas and water.
  - Take pictures of any broken things.

... and start making another todo list :-)
