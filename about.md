Hi! I’m Mahmood. I’m a software engineer. I’m originally from Bangladesh, currently living in Netherlands with my
 wife. I love working with anything that has something to do with code.

#### How I spend my spare time?
- I write code. Because I can or I've no life.
- Think about the singularity, upload myself to the internet.
- Read books and watch Netflix.
- I also do mentoring, if you want to be an apprentice, contact. No money involve.
